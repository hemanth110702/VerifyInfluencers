# VerifyInfluencers

## Todo
there are 3 tasks overall,
1) influencers discovery - based on influencers name, and some parameters
2) claim verification - Determine a verification status (Verified, Questionable, Debunked) and assign a trust score (just use AI to make up a scoring system).
3) dashboard with leaderboard - showing influencers, their trust scores, follower counts, and claim stats.
